# VIRTUAL TYPEWRITER
Take a blast from the past with this typewriter in a terminal!

# SETUP
Install a C++ compiler!
```
sudo apt install g++
```

Install ncurses:
```
sudo apt install libncurses-dev
```

Run the Makefile:

```
make
```

# RUNNING
Let's open a file named 'hello.c'
```
./a.out hello.c
```
Each line is entered one at a time, with the virtual paper moving up with each line entry, like in real life.

Press `F1` to save, and `F9` to quit.
